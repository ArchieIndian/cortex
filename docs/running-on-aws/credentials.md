# Credentials

1. Follow this [tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key) to create an access key.
2. Enable programmatic access for the IAM user, and attach the built-in `AdministratorAccess` policy to your IAM user.
3. See [security](security.md) if you'd like to use less privileged credentials after spinning up your cluster.
